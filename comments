[QUOTE="Elwyn, post: 2228701, member: 205470"]This IPChanger works for any version of Tibia

Download: https://github.com/gugahoa/ipchanger-otbr/archive/master.zip
Repository: https://github.com/gugahoa/ipchanger-otbr

How to use:
(You need to have Python3.4)

First you need to install pip https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html
Instructions:
[spoiler]Download: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
After downloading get-pip.py, go to the folder where it is and run:
[code]
$ sudo python3.4 get-pip.py
$ sudo pip3.4 install python-ptrace
[/code]
[/spoiler]

Then you have to run the following commands so that the IPChanger can attach to the Tibia process:
[code]$ echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope[/code]

If you don't want to run the commands above, edit /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf and change:
[code]
kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 1
[/code]
To
[code]
kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0
[/code]

Then you just need to go to where you extracted the ipchanger and execute main.py:
[code]
./main.py

I should have written:
If you don't want to run the commands above every time you restart the pc, edit /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf and change:[/QUOTE]
